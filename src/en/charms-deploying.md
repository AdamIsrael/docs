Title: Deploying services  
TODO: First section spent defining charms. This should all be placed in charms.md and
	linked to from here. As of this writing, that page does not cover local charms.
      Removed (commented out) section 'References and examples' due to the
	references being 3 years old and not offering much at all.
      This page is too long and should be broken up (or apply the fabled TOC).
      Review: 'channel support' points (especially #2). See https://goo.gl/IKzRsD .


# Deploying services

The fundamental point of Juju is that you can use it to deploy services through
the use of charms (the magic bits of code that make things just work). These
charms can exist remotely (online Charm Store) or locally (previously
downloaded or written by you).

Just as there are different series of Ubuntu ('precise', 'raring', etc) there
needs to be different series of charms. For the most part, this is transparent
as Juju will always try to use the most relevant charm. Deploying services with
Juju is designed to be easy.


## Deploying from the charm store

Typically, services are deployed using the online charms. This ensures that
you get the latest version of the charm. To deploy in this way:

```bash
juju deploy mysql
```

This will create a machine and use the latest online MySQL charm (for your
default series) to deploy a MySQL service.

!!! Note: The default series can be configured at a model level (see
[Configuring model](./models-config.htmls)). In the absence of this setting,
the default is to use the Ubuntu version running on the Juju client (i.e. where
the Juju commands are being invoked).

Juju supports a system of namespaces that means you can actually
deploy charms from a variety of sources. The default source is the charm store.
The above command is the same as running:

```bash
juju deploy cs:precise/mysql
```

which follows the format:

```nohighlight
<repository>:<series>/<service>
```

### Channel support	

The charm store offers the availability of charms in different stages of
developement. Such stages are called *channels*.

```bash
juju deploy mysql --channel &lt;channel&gt;
```

Such a channel will be used if the charm's revision is:

 1. undefined
 1. defined only for the specified non-stable channel

Each channel will have a "pointer" that redirects to a certain *revision*.
Because the pointer can get reversed and point to a later
revision, the following can occur on charm upgrade - if a charm revision that a
channel points to is different than the current revision of a deployed charm:
If a revision is older, downgrade the charm revision
If a revision is newer, do an upgrade.


```bash
juju charm-upgrade mysql --channel &lt;channel&gt;
```

Only do an upgrade if a pointer of a channel changes a charm revision. 

If there is a charm in the channel with a newer revision than the currently
deployed one, but the pointer is currently not pointing to it, do not perform
an upgrade - that revision either was not approved yet or was revoked from
being a default revision for the channel.
juju status
In the status, we show the ID of the charm. We could provide an additional
information about the channel in brackets by the name if a charm has not been
published to the stable channel to indicate this explicitly to the user.


## Deploying from local charms

This topic is covered in
[Deploying charms offline](./juju-offline-charms.html).


## Deploying with a configuration file

Deployed services usually start with a sane default configuration. However, for
some services it is desirable (and quicker) to configure them at deployment
time. This can be done by creating a YAML format file of configuration values
and using the `--config=` switch:

```bash
juju deploy mysql --config=myconfig.yaml
```

There is more information on this, and other ways to configure services in the
[documentation for configuring services](./charms-config.html).

!!! Note: After Juju resolves a charm and its dependencies, it bundles them and
deploys them to a machine provider charm cache/repository (e.g.
~/.juju/charmcache).  This allows the same charm to be deployed to multiple
machines repeatably and with minimal network transfers.


## Deploying to specific machines and containers

Juju has native support for specifying which machine a charm should be deployed
to. This is useful for a few reasons. The most obvious reason is to save money
when deploying to a public cloud. Instead of having one machine per unit we can
consolidate services.

In this example we use the `--constraints` flag to fire up a bootstrap node with
4G of RAM so we can deploy other services to it by using the `--to` command:

```bash
juju bootstrap --constraints="mem=4G"
juju deploy --to 0 mysql
juju deploy --to 0 rabbitmq-server
```

As you can see from the example we've deployed mysql and rabbitmq-server "to"
node 0.

You can also deploy to containers:

```bash
juju deploy mysql --to 24/lxd/3
juju deploy mysql --to lxd:25
```

In the previous example we deployed MySQL to container #3 on machine #24.
Similarly the 2nd example deploys MySQL to a new container on machine #25.

The above examples show how to deploy to a machine where you know the machine's
identifier â€“ in all deployments, machine 0 is always the bootstrap node so
the above example works nicely. Doing a `juju status` will show you a list of
all the machines and their machine numbers for you to decide what to deploy to.

It is also possible to deploy units using placement directives as --to arguments.
Placement directives are provider specific. For example:

```bash
juju deploy mysql --to zone=us-east-1a
juju deploy mysql --to host.mass
```
The first example deploys to a specified zone for AWS.
The second example deploys to a named machine in MAAS.

The `add-unit` command also supports the `--to` option, so it's now possible to
specifically target machines when expanding service capacity:

```bash
juju deploy --constraints="mem=4G" openstack-dashboard
juju add-unit --to 1 rabbitmq-server
```

I should now have a second machine running both the openstack-dashboard service
and a second unit of the rabbitmq-server service:

```bash
juju status
```

Which results in the following

```yaml
    machines:
      "0":
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.11.4
        dns-name: 10.5.0.44
        instance-id: 99a06a9b-a9f9-4c4a-bce3-3b87fbc869ee
        series: precise
        hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=2 mem=4096M
      "1":
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.11.4
        dns-name: 10.5.0.45
        instance-id: d1c6788a-d120-44c3-8c55-03aece997fd7
        series: precise
        hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=2 mem=4096M
    services:
      mysql:
        charm: cs:precise/mysql-26
        exposed: false
        relations:
          cluster:
          - mysql
        units:
          mysql/0:
            agent-state: started
            agent-version: 1.11.4
            machine: "0"
            public-address: 10.5.0.44
      openstack-dashboard:
        charm: cs:precise/openstack-dashboard-9
        exposed: false
        relations:
          cluster:
          - openstack-dashboard
        units:
          openstack-dashboard/0:
            agent-state: started
            agent-version: 1.11.4
            machine: "1"
            public-address: 10.5.0.45
      rabbitmq-server:
        charm: cs:precise/rabbitmq-server-12
        exposed: false
        relations:
          cluster:
          - rabbitmq-server
        units:
          rabbitmq-server/0:
            agent-state: started
            agent-version: 1.11.4
            machine: "0"
            public-address: 10.5.0.44
          rabbitmq-server/1:
            agent-state: started
            agent-version: 1.11.4
            machine: "1"
            public-address: 10.5.0.45
```

These two features make it much easier to deploy complex services such as
OpenStack which use a large number of charms on a limited number of physical
servers.

As with deploy, the --to option used with `add-unit` also supports placement
directives. A comma separated list of directives can be provided to cater for 
the case where more than one unit is being added.

```bash
juju add-unit rabbitmq-server -n 4 --to zone=us-west-1a,zone=us-east-1b
juju add-unit rabbitmq-server -n 4 --to host1,host2,host3,host4
```

Any extra placement directives are ignored. If not enough placement directives
are supplied, then the remaining units will be assigned as normal to a new, clean
machine.


## Juju retry-provisioning

You can use the `retry-provisioning` command in cases where deploying services,
adding units, or adding machines fails. It allows you to specify machines which
should be retried to resolve errors reported with `juju status`.

For example, after having deployed 100 units and machines, status reports that
machines 3, 27 and 57 could not be provisioned because of a 'rate limit exceeded'
error. You can ask Juju to retry:

```bash
juju retry-provisioning 3 27 5
```


## Considerations

Charms are running without any separation, so its entirely possible for charms
to stomp all over each others configuration files and try to bind to the same
network ports. We are working to containerize everything so that this does not
happen and every service is in its own container, but this work is not yet
complete.

While the "add-unit" command supports the `--to` option, you can elect not use
`--to` when doing an "add-unit" to scale out the service on its own node.

```bash
juju add-unit rabbitmq-server
```

This will allow you to save money when you need it by using --to, but also
horizontally scale out on dedicated machines when you need to.


## Selecting and enabling networks

Use the `networks` option to specify service-specific network requirements. The
`networks` option takes a comma-delimited list of juju-specific network names.
Juju will enable the networks on the machines that host service units. This is
different from the network constraint which selects a machine that matches the
networks, but does not configure the machine to use them. For example, this
commands deploys a service to a machine on the "db" and "monitor" networks and
enabled them:

```bash
juju deploy --networks db,monitor mysql
```
