### juju add-credential

The `juju add-credential` command supports adding a credential with a YAML
file. 

The YAML input format is identical to the format Juju uses to store credentials
on a user's filesystem. However, the manually created file can only be used to
add one credential at a time, unlike the file generated by Juju which can
contain multiple credentials.

The format must also include a root key of "credentials:".

For example, the following 'azure.yaml' file will fail.

```yaml
azure:
  rickscreds:
      auth-type: service-principal-secret
      application-id: 1234
      application-password: secretpassword
      subscription-id: 12345
      tenant-id: 12345
```

Once the root key is added, it will succeed:

```yaml
credentials:
    azure:
      rickstuff:
          auth-type: service-principal-secret
          ...
```
